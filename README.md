Gilbert - The 411

Hi, my name is Gilbert. I have over 7 years of experience in IT. I like computers, football (soccer), video games, movies, art, travel and hiking. I enjoy raising the football-soccer banter, I personally think its football considering you do a lot of kicking but I digress. Stepping of a plane ready to explore "uncharted territory" has to be one of the best feelings. I like to try out new eats and spots, if you're ever in Toronto let me know I will hook you up. Would never say no to a good barbecue especially right now, its barbecue season !! or a weekend trip to the lake. 

Despite my love for computers my career didn't start off in IT/Tech. That's a story for another but I found my way back to my true calling after a couple years working in Biotechnology. I enjoy harmless banter like the football thing I did at the beginning.

I am currently living and working in Toronto which I think is a great city a real melting pot of cultures; you always feel connected regardless of your roots or heritage. Winters are not as long and cold as in Edmonton or Calgary, its not constantly raining like in Vancouver. Being a hiker the surrounding areas has always offered an avenue to get lost in nature. You just need to take a short drive outside the inner city.

My favorite joke goes Q: Why did the bucket go to the doctor ? A: It was looking so pail!. So you're total laughing at my incredible ingenuity or my lack of humor but either way the joke did it job.

I believe that as much information as I would like to share, you'd have to buy me coffee and treat to see if I would be willing to share more. No guarantees!
